            <strong>My Fitness Journey:</strong>
            <br />
            From struggle to strength. In 2018, my fitness journey began, fueled
            by dissatisfaction with my health. A decade of on-and-off gym visits
            had left me overweight and unhappy. Enter CrossFit â€” an initial love
            affair with heavy weights that, while invigorating, wasnâ€™t
            sustainable for me.
            <br />
            <br />
            Shifting to dedicated strength training five years ago proved
            transformative. Beyond physical changes, this journey brought mental
            clarity and better nutritional choices. Recognizing its impact on
            anxiety and depression, I felt called to help others.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now, through education and coaching, Iâ€™m passionate about guiding
            others to embrace the process and discover joy in the journey.
            Whether itâ€™s building strength, living healthier, intuitive eating,
            or conquering everyday feats.
            <br />
            <strong>Letâ€™s make your goals a reality together!</strong>
